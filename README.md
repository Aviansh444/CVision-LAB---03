## 🔬 Theory

A **Mean Filter** is a spatial filtering technique used for image smoothing.

It replaces the value of each pixel with the average of the pixel values in its neighborhood.

The mean is calculated using:

**Mean = Sum of neighboring pixel values / Number of neighboring pixels**

### 3×3 Mean Filter

A 3×3 filter contains **9 pixels**:

```text
Mean = Sum of 9 pixels / 9
```

### 5×5 Mean Filter

A 5×5 filter contains **25 pixels**:

```text
Mean = Sum of 25 pixels / 25
```

### 7×7 Mean Filter

A 7×7 filter contains **49 pixels**:

```text
Mean = Sum of 49 pixels / 49
```

As the filter size increases, more neighboring pixels are considered, resulting in stronger smoothing.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The program performs the following steps:

1. Read the input image using OpenCV.
2. Convert the image from BGR to grayscale.
3. Create output arrays for 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 filters.
4. Calculate the average of neighboring pixels using nested loops.
5. Generate the filtered images.
6. Display the original grayscale image and filtered images.
7. Save the combined output as `Mean_Filter_Output.png`.
8. Display the image dimensions.

---

## 💻 Implementation

The mean filters are implemented manually using nested loops.

### 3×3 Filter

For every pixel, the program considers a 3×3 neighborhood and calculates:

```python
total // 9
```

### 5×5 Filter

For every pixel, a 5×5 neighborhood is considered:

```python
total // 25
```

### 7×7 Filter

For every pixel, a 7×7 neighborhood is considered:

```python
total // 49
```

The use of `//` performs integer division to obtain the average pixel value.

## 📊 Observation

| Filter      | Kernel Size | Smoothing Effect   |
| ----------- | ----------: | ------------------ |
| Mean Filter |         3×3 | Low smoothing      |
| Mean Filter |         5×5 | Moderate smoothing |
| Mean Filter |         7×7 | High smoothing     |

### Observation

* The **3×3 filter** produces slight smoothing while preserving more details.
* The **5×5 filter** produces greater smoothing and removes more fine details.
* The **7×7 filter** produces the strongest smoothing effect.
* Increasing the kernel size causes the image to become smoother but can result in loss of fine details.

## 📐 Output Size

Since the program does not use padding, the output image becomes smaller depending on the filter size.

For an input image of size:

```text
rows × cols
```

the output dimensions are:

```text
3×3 → (rows - 2) × (cols - 2)

5×5 → (rows - 4) × (cols - 4)

7×7 → (rows - 6) × (cols - 6)
```

The program also prints the original image shape, grayscale image shape, and the output shapes.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Mean Filtering was successfully implemented using **3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 kernels**.

The experiment demonstrates that increasing the kernel size increases the smoothing effect. However, larger filters can also remove fine image details.

Thus, the choice of filter size depends on the required level of image smoothing and detail preservation.
